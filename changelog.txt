    11-28-2021
// ----------------------------------------------------------- //

- Falling Carrots will no longer appear at random, but instead have a chance of appearing when you click the main carrot.
  + This is subject to change but I think this rewards clicking better and avoids making the player feel like they're missing something while they are away from the carrot

- Moved themes, cosmetics, and achievement data into gamedata.js

- Most of the themes should now support most of the newer features
- Fixed the issue where there would be extra space underneath the achievements tab (Issue #42)

- Added some character specific cosmetics (fancy bill and safety greg)
  + Note: You can't mix and match cosmetics yet
- New collectible: Pages
  + These are the replacement for the achievement percentage = prestige buff mechanic- for every page you have, you will earn +1% golden carrots when you prestige. Pages are earned by completing achievements.
  + There is support for balance changes here: if the page reward(s) for an achievement are changed in an update the game will update the player's page count accordingly
- Added an achievement for unlocking every achievement (excluding secret achievements)

What's new:

// ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    VERSION dev beta 1.4.1.1 hotfix
    11-6-2021

    + First Netherite Hoe
- Reduced statistics refresh time to 2 seconds

// ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    VERSION dev beta 1.4.0
    11-5-2021

What's new:
- Fancy theme switcher:
    + Hides themes that have not been unlocked
    + Tells you how many remaining themes you have to unlock
- unlock() function now works (for themes, since there is no cosmetic switcher at the moment)
- Achievements:
    + Not quite complete, but in terms of JS they're basically done
    + Some achievements may not work properly (specifically ones with multiple conditions)
    + Still need to have them appear in the achievements tab
    + Still need to give them a unique style of toast that can display an image and tell you what unlocks come with
- Compatibility for old save files:
    + Achievements and unlockables have been added to the player object, and because of the way the game stores said object I've had to add some checks to make sure that the required properties are added. I don't know if this will stay, but for now you can continue playing without losing your save.

Fixes:
- Fixed the confetti element always being visible and causing a white border around the screen
- Hoes are now craftable again (n variable was missing)
- Statistics now displays actual data (only 2 numbers actually show up at the moment)
