// ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    VERSION dev beta 1.5.0
    11-10-2021
// ----------------------------------------------------------- //

- Gave some achievements pixel art
- Changed all images to be rendered pixelated
- Game now keeps track of how fast you are clicking and displays it (there is also a related achievement)
- Fixed issue where the welcome message and temporary fix messages wouldn't appear when intended (temporary fix message is now gone)
- DOM Manipulation doesn't take place unless necessary: Swapped out the usage of .innerText for eInnerText() and innerHTML for eInnerHTML() which doesn't update the page if the intended output is the same as what is already there (hopefully this will improve performance, I'm not able to test if there's a difference)
- The carrot counter also now updates instantly, instead of on a timer with everything elements
  + Depending on if I feel like doing the work I'll also make this change for the other page elements in the future
- Achievements tab is pretty much complete! You can now view a list of achievements and read their descriptions if you need something to do.
- Increased the size of the tri-panel section at the bottom of the page (this may change again in the future)

Known issues:
- Achievement rewards display on achievements they don't belong to
- Achievements still use normal toasts

// ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    VERSION dev beta 1.4.2
    11-6-2021
// ----------------------------------------------------------- //

What's new:
- Sound effects when clicking the carrot and certain buttons (currently the sound effects being used have background noise so they are subject to change- if they become annoying you can disable them in settings)
- Options in settings to disable all sound effects or just carrot sound effects
- Changed OLED Theme description:
  "Dark theme compatible with OLED screens" -> "Don't play Carrot Clicker after midnight"
- Made some pieces of text a light gray instead of white in an attempt to improve visual heirarchy a little
- Moved fun tip percentage to be higher up in settings

Achievements:
- "Bill of the Century" achievement now gives you the bill cosmetic (no way to enable cosmetics yet)
- use_charles achievement now works (needed its own function);
- Achievement notification will now tell you if you've earned a reward for completing it (generic toast notifications are temporary, achievements will have their own style of toasts later)

Fixes:
- Clicking on the same theme more than once makes the checkmark disappear
- Retro Green theme no longer makes Greg's progress bar red
- Fun tips slider knob actually reaches the end(s) of the slider and is slightly bigger
- Lots of other random fixes, mostly related to achievements

Known issues:
- Upgrade prices increase at an insane rate
- Save file compatibility doesn't always work- you may need to start over for themes/achievements to work.
- Achievements tab not actually doing anything
- Carrot sound effects being bad

// ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    VERSION dev beta 1.4.1.1 hotfix
    11-6-2021
// ----------------------------------------------------------- //

- "Compatibility for old save files" mentioned in 1.4 should now work properly- previously, players with old save files would not be given the default themes and the theme switcher would be useless.

~ Kal


// ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    VERSION dev beta 1.4.1
    11-5-2021
// ----------------------------------------------------------- //

- Statistics now tells you how many achievements, themes, and cosmetics out of the total you have
- Added two achievements:
    + First Hoe (Triggers tutorial message same as before)
    + First Netherite Hoe
- Reduced statistics refresh time to 2 seconds

Fixes:
- Fixed certain images not appearing (their src attribute didn't have a "." at the start). I think this might also be why the character avatars were disappearing but we'll have to see if that goes away or not.

// ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    VERSION dev beta 1.4.0
    11-5-2021
// ----------------------------------------------------------- //

What's new:
- Fancy theme switcher:
    + Hides themes that have not been unlocked
    + Tells you how many remaining themes you have to unlock
- unlock() function now works (for themes, since there is no cosmetic switcher at the moment)
- Achievements:
    + Not quite complete, but in terms of JS they're basically done
    + Some achievements may not work properly (specifically ones with multiple conditions)
    + Still need to have them appear in the achievements tab
    + Still need to give them a unique style of toast that can display an image and tell you what unlocks come with
- Compatibility for old save files:
    + Achievements and unlockables have been added to the player object, and because of the way the game stores said object I've had to add some checks to make sure that the required properties are added. I don't know if this will stay, but for now you can continue playing without losing your save.

Fixes:
- Fixed the confetti element always being visible and causing a white border around the screen
- Hoes are now craftable again (n variable was missing)
- Statistics now displays actual data (only 2 numbers actually show up at the moment)

    11-3-2021

- Toast elements were not being deleted properly (ID being used to delete them was on a child element intstead of the element itself)

- confetti() function

Themes:
- Started working on a fancy theme switcher, just need to make the interface (HTML) itself
