CSS changes:
- Top bar no longer pushes rest of page down when its size changes
- Charles now stays in the same column as the other characters ~~(Assuming there isn't space for him on the right)~~ not added yet
- General CSS cleanup

Themes:
- Theme dropdown in settings pane
- New WIP light theme
- WIP Classic theme (Original Carrot Clicker CSS, green outlines and all)
- Themes are able to change mobile accent color to match
- Theme is automatically stored and loaded using localStorage
- More themes are planned

Misc:
- Statistics and achievements tabs have swapped places, achievements is open by default
- Multibuy (1x) indicator in the top left can be clicked to change it
- Fixed issue on mobile where touble tapping the carrot (or anything on the page) would zoom (needs to be tested, seems to work on my phone though)
- A progress bar will appear directly below the status bar while Greg is crafting (unfinished)

Still need to do:
- Charles spills over to a 2nd column when there is enough room
- Status bar progress bar needs to work
- Make settings look nicer
